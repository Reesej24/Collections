Building this program made me realize where I am still needing some practice with creating loops and conditional statements. I had an idea of how I wanted this program to look, but it took a lot of research and looking for examples of how to create the loop for the output I wanted. It took some research to find how to use the Character class and what method to use to ignore spacing and punctuation. Alongside the content and examples provided in class, I found some examples online that helped me put this code together. When I first built it, I was getting the output multiple times because I put the output inside the loop. Once I figured that out, it all fell into place. I am recognizing the areas where I still need quite a bit of practice to be able to put together a code like this without doing the research.
